Here is my ultra mini tutorial on how to use git, with some links for 
downloading and installing Git and the Git GUI.

Getting Set Up
--------------

First, download and install the latest version of Git. This isn't the GUI,
but this will enable you to do anything and everything with Git from the
command line. I do not have experience with the Windows command line, but
the Git commands may be slightly different.

Next download GitHub, which is the GUI. This simplifies (and visualizes) 
some of the more tedious parts of the commands you would have to do via
the command line.
